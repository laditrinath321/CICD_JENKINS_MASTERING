## Pipeline Overview

The Jenkins pipelines in this repository are designed to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying a Java application. The pipelines use Maven for building the application and Tomcat for deployment.

## Environment Variables

The pipelines use the following environment variables for configuration:

- `GIT_URL`: Git repository URL
- `BRANCH`: Git branch to clone
- `TOMCAT_URL`: Tomcat server URL
- `TOMCAT_CREDENTIALS_ID`: Credentials ID for Tomcat deployment
- `CONTEXT_PATH`: Context path for the app deployment

## Stages

### Clone Repository

This stage clones the specified Git repository and branch.

### Build with Maven

This stage builds the application using Maven.

### Deploy to Tomcat

This stage deploys the built `.war` file to a Tomcat server.

### Parallel Deployment

This stage demonstrates deploying to multiple environments in parallel.

## Error Handling

The pipelines include error handling using `try` and `catch` blocks to ensure the build continues even if a stage fails.

## Webhook Integration

The pipelines support GitHub webhook integration to trigger builds on code changes.

## Best Practices

- **Use Environment Variables**: Define reusable environment variables to make the pipeline cleaner and more flexible.
- **Parallel Stages**: Use parallel stages to deploy to multiple environments simultaneously, reducing deployment time.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to ensure the pipeline continues even if a stage fails.
- **Clean Workspace**: Use the `cleanWs()` step to clean the workspace before starting a new build to avoid conflicts.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- **Git Clone Failures**: Ensure the Git repository URL and branch are correct. Check network connectivity and Git credentials.
- **Maven Build Failures**: Verify the `pom.xml` file for any issues. Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified.
- **Tomcat Deployment Failures**: Check the Tomcat server URL and credentials. Ensure the Tomcat server is running and accessible.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates how to set up a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Maven, and Tomcat. The pipelines include features such as environment variables, parallel stages, error handling, and webhook integration to ensure a smooth and automated deployment process. By following best practices and troubleshooting common issues, you can effectively manage and deploy your Java applications.
